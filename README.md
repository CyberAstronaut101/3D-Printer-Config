# 3D Printer Config Repo

This repo tracks various config files for my 3D printers.


## Filament Used

I exclusively use [Fusion Filaments](https://fusionfilaments.com/) for FFF printing.

Any Klipper tunes are for Fusion Filament unless otherwise stated. 

## Ender 3 Pro

The Ender 3 has been a great investment and has been going strong for the past three years. Below are the modifications.
